# Scripts Cleanup Summary

## 🧹 What Was Cleaned Up

All obsolete and unused scripts have been removed from the `scripts/` directory for a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

## 🗑️ Deleted Scripts

### Legacy Conversion Scripts (Already Removed Previously)
- ~~`convert_model.py`~~ - Old DeBERTa-specific converter
- ~~`convert_solidity_vulnerability.py`~~ - Old GraphCodeBERT-specific converter

**Reason:** Replaced by the universal `convert_to_onnx.py` converter

### Migration Scripts (Removed)
- ✅ **`migrate-models.sh`** - Shell script for migrating models
- ✅ **`migrate-models.ps1`** - PowerShell script for migrating models  
- ✅ **`migrate-models-simple.ps1`** - Simplified migration script

**Reason:** One-time use scripts for historical migrations. No longer needed as:
- Models are now in the correct location
- New setup uses `config/models.json`
- Migration has been completed

### Test Scripts (Removed)
- ✅ **`test-tokenizer-setup.sh`** - Shell script for testing tokenizer setup
- ✅ **`test-tokenizer-setup.bat`** - Batch script for testing tokenizer setup

**Reason:** 
- Specific to old architecture
- Not relevant with current unified converter
- Testing is now handled by the main scripts

## ✅ Kept Scripts

### Active Scripts (In Use)

```
scripts/
├── convert_to_onnx.py           ← Universal model converter
├── download_missing_models.py   ← Model download orchestrator
├── build-and-run.sh             ← Build & run utility (Linux/Mac)
├── build-and-run.bat            ← Build & run utility (Windows)
└── README.md                    ← Documentation
```

### Why These Were Kept

1. **`convert_to_onnx.py`**
   - ✅ Universal converter for all HuggingFace models
   - ✅ Actively used by `download_missing_models.py`
   - ✅ Core functionality

2. **`download_missing_models.py`**
   - ✅ Orchestrates model downloads
   - ✅ Called by Dockerfile during build
   - ✅ Core functionality

3. **`build-and-run.sh`** / **`build-and-run.bat`**
   - ✅ Convenient utility for developers
   - ✅ Automates common tasks
   - ✅ Cross-platform support

4. **`README.md`**
   - ✅ Essential documentation
   - ✅ How-to guide for users

## 📊 Impact

### Before Cleanup

```
scripts/
├── convert_to_onnx.py              ← Keep
├── download_missing_models.py      ← Keep
├── build-and-run.sh                ← Keep
├── build-and-run.bat               ← Keep
├── migrate-models.sh               ← DELETE (146 lines)
├── migrate-models.ps1              ← DELETE (120 lines)
├── migrate-models-simple.ps1       ← DELETE (56 lines)
├── test-tokenizer-setup.sh         ← DELETE (136 lines)
├── test-tokenizer-setup.bat        ← DELETE (similar)
└── README.md                       ← Keep

Total: 10 files, ~1000+ lines of scripts
```

### After Cleanup

```
scripts/
├── convert_to_onnx.py              ← Active
├── download_missing_models.py      ← Active
├── build-and-run.sh                ← Active
├── build-and-run.bat               ← Active
└── README.md                       ← Active

Total: 5 files, clean and focused
```

**Result:**
- **5 scripts removed** (~500+ lines of obsolete code deleted)
- **50% fewer files** in scripts directory
- **100% of kept scripts are actively used**

## ✨ Benefits

### 1. Clarity
- ✅ No confusion about which scripts to use
- ✅ Clear purpose for each remaining script
- ✅ Easier for new developers to understand

### 2. Maintainability
- ✅ Less code to maintain
- ✅ No risk of using outdated scripts
- ✅ Focused codebase

### 3. Repository Hygiene
- ✅ No dead code
- ✅ Cleaner git history going forward
- ✅ Faster to search and navigate

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ README now only documents active scripts
- ✅ No need to explain deprecated features
- ✅ Simpler onboarding

## 🔍 Verification

### Check Remaining Scripts

```bash
ls -la scripts/
```

**Expected output:**
```
build-and-run.bat
build-and-run.sh
convert_to_onnx.py
download_missing_models.py
README.md
```

### Test Functionality

```bash
# Test model download system
python scripts/download_missing_models.py --check-only

# Test conversion script
python scripts/convert_to_onnx.py --help

# Test build utility (optional)
./scripts/build-and-run.sh
```

All should work perfectly! ✅

## 📝 What If I Need Old Scripts?

### Git History

All deleted scripts are still available in git history:

```bash
# Find when a script was deleted
git log --all --full-history -- scripts/migrate-models.sh

# Recover a script if needed
git checkout <commit-hash> -- scripts/migrate-models.sh
```

### Archives

If you need the migration logic for reference:
1. Check git history
2. Check documentation in `docs/` folder
3. The functionality is now built into the main scripts

## 🎯 Going Forward

### When to Add New Scripts

Only add scripts that are:
- ✅ **Actively used** in the workflow
- ✅ **Not temporary** (not for one-time tasks)
- ✅ **Well documented** in README
- ✅ **Tested** and working

### When to Remove Scripts

Remove scripts that are:
- ❌ No longer used
- ❌ Replaced by better alternatives
- ❌ One-time migration tools (after migration)
- ❌ Broken and not worth fixing

### Best Practices

1. **Document purpose** - Every script should have clear purpose
2. **Keep it lean** - Only scripts that are actively used
3. **Regular cleanup** - Remove obsolete scripts promptly
4. **Git history** - Don't fear deletion, git remembers

## 📚 Related Changes

This cleanup is part of a larger refactoring:

1. **Unified Converter** - `convert_to_onnx.py` replaces all model-specific converters
2. **JSON Configuration** - `config/models.json` drives everything
3. **Simplified Structure** - Cleaner project layout
4. **Better Documentation** - Focused on active features

See:
- `docs/UNIFIED_CONVERTER.md` - Universal converter
- `docs/CONFIG_SIMPLIFICATION.md` - JSON config improvements
- `docs/CONFIG_RELOCATION.md` - Config directory structure

## ✅ Summary

**Scripts Directory Status: CLEAN ✨**

- ✅ 5 scripts remain (all active and necessary)
- ✅ 5+ obsolete scripts removed
- ✅ ~500+ lines of dead code eliminated
- ✅ 100% of remaining scripts are actively used
- ✅ Clear, maintainable, focused codebase

**The scripts directory is now lean, clean, and purposeful!** 🚀
